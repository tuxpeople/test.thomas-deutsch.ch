Thank you for using scriptogr.am. While we’re still in early beta development, we think you’ll enjoy the app. It’s designed to be fast, simple and to get the most creativity out of you.

scriptogr.am uses [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/ "Markdown"), a lightweight markup language, originally created by [John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/ "Daring Fireball") and [Aaron Swartz](http://www.aaronsw.com/ "Aaron Swartz"). Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML). See the [Syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax "Markdown syntax") page for details pertaining to Markdown’s formatting syntax. You can try it out, right now, using the online [Dingus](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/dingus "Dingus").
